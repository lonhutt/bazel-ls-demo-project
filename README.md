# bazel-ls-demo-project

Demo project for testing and developing the Bazel language server.
The initial focus is on **Java**.

While Bazel provides a ton of flexibility, this flexibility is not something the Bazel language server will support initially.
Instead we are starting with a focus on a recommended module structure extremely similar to Maven projects.
